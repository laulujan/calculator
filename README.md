# Calculator

The Odin Project: JavaScript Vanilla Calculator

## Assignment
1. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each operator (+, -, *, %, =), display and clear button.
2. Gotchas: watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:
- Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. **Note** Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
- You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
- Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!
